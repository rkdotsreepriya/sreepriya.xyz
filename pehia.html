                <h3>Zee Camp</h3>
                <p>Pehia Foundation, for the past year, have been working towards bridging
                    the gender gap in the tech field, with the focus on women in Kochi. The
                    voyage over this arena has been successful with the ebb and flow of the
                    diverse activities conducted so far. Albeit the success over the women-tech
                    communities and the activities, Pehia had been thinking about the chances
                    of extending our activities over to the transgender society, to remove the
                    gender bias and boundaries in this field.</p>
